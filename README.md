# Server Security
There are ways to hack into your servers if you do not protect it properly!
Hackers will find the port for your Minecraft Server and since it has been
put into offline-mode they can sign-in to your server with whatever username
they want. This means they could say to the server that they are OwnersName
without any sort of proof. If you use a plugin like [IPWhitelist](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ipwhitelist.61/) or [BungeeGuard](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ipwhitelist.61/)
you can quickly eliminate these sorts of hacks from your server!
